\title{Dataset with continuous outcomes}
\format{
This data frame contains the following columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{participant ID}
\item{trt1}{treatment received in stage 1 - possible values: 1 (placebo), 2, 3}
\item{stage1outcome}{a number between 0-100 that represents the stage 1 treatment effect}
\item{stay}{indicates whether the participant stayed on the same treatment arm in stage 2 - possible values: 0 (didn't stay), 1 (stayed)}
\item{trt2}{treatment received in stage 2 - possible values: 2, 3}
\item{stage2outcome}{a number between 0-100 that represents the stage 2 treatment effect}
